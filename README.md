# Credit-card-approval using machine learning
I Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP). 
# Glimpse of the project:
Our Credit-card-approval project involves defining the problem, collecting and preprocessing data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA),and
experimenting with different machine learning algorithms Logistic Regression,K-NearestNeighbor,Random Forest and Support Vector Machine.
We compared the results to recommend the best Logistic Regression model.
