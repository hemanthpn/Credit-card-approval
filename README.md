# Credit-card-approval using machine learning
Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP). 
# Glimpse of the project:
Our Credit-card-approval project involves defining the problem, collecting and preprocessing data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), selecting and training a model, and evaluating it.
Once validated, the model is tested, deployed, and monitored for performance.
